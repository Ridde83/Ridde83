- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ridde83
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

I´ve made my first CryptoCurrency Project just for fun. If anyone would like to help for example to update the wallet in Dinarcoin feel free to do that.
I´m just a beginner i don´t have much knowledge about coding. 

For the moment these are the things i would like to make in my Dinarcoin project: 
1. To update the Wallet Core to the latset version.
2. To have Qrcode in the wallet.
3. To have paper wallet in the wallet.
4. To make the wallet work on Windows and Mac.
5. To have a Block explorer.
If anyone has more ideas, feel free to code on my repository in Dinarcoin, i will really appreciate it.
